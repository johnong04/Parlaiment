# Project Specifications: Malaysian Hansard Analytics (FYP)

## 1. Project Context (CRITICAL)
* **Type:** Final Year Project (Data Science Undergraduate).
* **Deadline:** < 24 Hours.
* **Goal:** A "functional prototype" dashboard to be shown in a video demo.
* **Core Narrative:** Bridging the "Hansard Gap" using NLP to detect "Evasiveness" in political speech.
* **Constraint:** "Hackathon Mode." Prioritize working visualizations and data flow over perfect software engineering. If a complex feature blocks progress, we simulate it or hard-code the specific demo path.

## 2. The Data Pipeline
* **Source:** ~15-20 PDF files of "Dewan Rakyat" Hansards (2018-2022).
* **Filter Strategy:** Focus on "Belanjawan" (Budget) and lengthy debates (>40 pages).
* **Parsing Logic (Library: `pdfplumber`):**
    * **Target:** Extract clean speech turns.
    * **Regex Pattern (Speech Start):** `^([A-Z][\w\s\'\.\-@]+)(?:\[.*?\])?:` 
        * *Explanation:* Matches "Speaker Name [Constituency]:" OR "Speaker Name:"
    * **Cleaning:** Remove headers/footers, page numbers, and lines containing "DR." or dates.
    * **Metadata:**
        * *Date:* Extracted from Filename (e.g., `DR-16072018.pdf` -> `16-07-2018`).
        * *Party:* Merged via a lookup table (CSV generated by LLM from the PDF member list).
* **Output:** A master `hansard_data.csv` with columns: `[Date, Speaker, Constituency, Party, Text]`.

## 3. The AI Models
### A. Topic Modeling (BERTopic)
* **Goal:** Unsupervised grouping of speeches into themes.
* **Config:** `language="multilingual"`, `calculate_probabilities=True`.
* **Post-Processing:** Map raw topic IDs (e.g., `0_ringgit_ekonomi`) to clean labels (e.g., "Economy") for the UI.

### B. Stance & Evasiveness Classification (The "Killer Feature")
* **Goal:** Classify every speech into 4 classes: `[Pro, Con, Neutral, Evasive]`.
* **Methodology (Hybrid):**
    1.  **Silver Labeling:** Use an LLM API to label a subset of speeches to create "Ground Truth" for the demo.
    2.  **Model:** If time permits, fine-tune `xlm-roberta-base`. If not, use the LLM-generated labels directly in the CSV for the visualization.
* **Demo Requirement:** The dashboard *must* show the "Evasive" class clearly (e.g., Yellow color code) to prove the thesis.

## 4. The Dashboard (Streamlit)
**Theme:** Professional, Academic, "Dark Mode" preferred for contrast.

### Tab 1: "The Pulse" (Temporal Analysis)
* **Visual:** Line Chart (Time vs. Topic Frequency).
* **Filter:** Select Topic (Dropdown).
* **Narrative:** Show how "Economy" spikes during Budget season and "Health" spikes during 2020.

### Tab 2: "The Stance" (Evasiveness Detector)
* **Visual:** Stacked Bar Chart (X=Party, Y=Count, Color=Stance).
* **Filter:** Select Topic.
* **Key Insight:** Show that Government Ministers often have high "Evasive" counts compared to Opposition "Con" counts.

### Tab 3: "Hansard Explorer" (Ground Truth)
* **Visual:** `st.dataframe` or custom HTML cards.
* **Feature:** Search/Filter by Speaker or Keyword.
* **Goal:** Allow the user to read the raw text to verify the model's accuracy.

## 5. "Smart" Features (Demo Enhancements)
* **MP Profiler (Hard-coded for Top 5):** When selecting "Anwar Ibrahim" or "Najib Razak", show a pre-calculated "Evasiveness Score" card.
* **Contextual Summary:** Display a pre-generated "Why is this evasive?" text snippet for selected data points.
